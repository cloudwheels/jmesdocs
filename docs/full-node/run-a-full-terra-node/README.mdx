# Run a full JMES node 

Running a full JMES node is a resource-intensive process that requires a persistent server. If you want to use JMES without downloading the entire blockchain, use [Keplr Wallet](https://station.jmes.money/).

If you are a developer and want to install JMESd, visit the [Install JMESd guide](../../develop/terrad/install-terrad.mdx).
