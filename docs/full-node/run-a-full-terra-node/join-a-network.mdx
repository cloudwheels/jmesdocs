# Join a network

It is highly recommended that you set up a private local network before joining a public network. This will help you get familiar with the setup process, and provide an environment for testing. The following sections outline this process. If you want to join a public network without setting up a private network, you can skip to [join a public network](#join-a-public-network).

## Set up a local private network

Validators can set up a private JMES network to become familiar with running a full JMES node before joining a public network.


<Admonition type="tip" icon="ðŸ’¡" title="LocalJMES">

If you are a developer and want to set up a local, WASM-enabled, private testnet for smart contracts, visit [install LocalJMES](../../develop/localterra/README.mdx).

### Create a single node

The simplest JMES network you can set up is a local testnet with just a single node. In a single-node environment, you have one account and are the only validator signing blocks for your private network.

1. Initialize your genesis file that will bootstrap the network. Replace the following variables with your own information:

   ```bash
     jmesd init --chain-id=<testnet-name> <node-moniker>
   ```

2. Generate a JMES account. Replace the variable with your account name:

   ```bash
   jmesd keys add <account-name>
   ```

<Admonition type="tip" icon="ðŸ’¡" title="Get tokens">

In order for JMESd to recognize a wallet address, it must contain tokens. For the testnet, use [the faucet](https://faucet.terra.money/) to send bJMES to your wallet. If you are on mainnet, send funds from an existing wallet. 1-3 bJMES are sufficient for most setup processes.

### Add your account to the genesis

Run the following commands to add your account and set the initial balance:

```bash
jmesd add-genesis-account $(jmesd keys show <account-name> -a) 100000000ubJMES
jmesd gentx <my-account> 10000000ubJMES --chain-id=<testnet-name>
jmesd collect-gentxs
```

### Start your private JMES network

Run the following command to start your private network:

```bash
jmesd start
```

If the private JMES network is set up correctly, your JMESd node will be running on `tcp://localhost:26656`, listening for incoming transactions, and signing blocks.

## Join a public network

These instructions are for setting up a brand new full node from scratch. You can join a public JMES network, such as the mainnet or testnet, by completing the following steps:

### 1. Select a network

Specify the network you want to join by choosing the corresponding **genesis file** and **seeds list**:

	| Network     | Type    | Genesis                                                                                        | Addressbook                                                                              | Seeds                                                                             |
| :---------- | :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `phoenix-1` | Mainnet | [Genesis Link](https://phoenix-genesis.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/genesis.json)                   |  Peer List Community maintained by [Polkachu](https://polkachu.com/addrbooks/jmes)      | [Seeds List](https://github.com/jmesworld/mainnet#seed-nodes)                   |
| `pisco-1`   | Testnet | [Genesis Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmesworld/testnet/master/pisco-1/genesis.json) |  Peer List Community maintained by [Polkachu](https://polkachu.com/testnets/jmes/peers) | [Seeds List](https://github.com/jmesworld/testnet/tree/main/pisco-1#seed-nodes) |

<Admonition type="tip" icon="ðŸ’¡" title="Selecting a network">

Note that the versions of the network listed above are the [latest versions](https://github.com/jmesworld/testnet/tree/master#latest-networks). To find earlier versions, please consult the [networks repo](https://github.com/jmesworld/testnet).

</Admonition>


### 2. Download genesis file and address book

**Genesis-transaction** specifies the account balances and parameters at the start of the network to use when replaying transactions and syncing.

**Addressbook** lists a selection of peers for your node to dial to in order to discover other nodes in the network. Public address books of peers are made available by the JMES community.

Choose a `testnet` or `mainnet` address type and download the appropriate genesis-transaction and addressbook. Links to these are posted in the [Select a network](#1-select-a-network) section.

- For default JMESd configurations, the `genesis` and `addressbook` files should be placed under `~/.jmes/config/genesis.json` and `~/.jmes/config/addrbook.json` respectively.

**Example**:

```bash
# Obtain the genesis for phoenix-1:
wget https://phoenix-genesis.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/genesis.json -O ~/.jmes/config/genesis.json

# Obtain the addressbook for the phoenix-1 from Polkachu:
wget https://snapshots1.polkachu.com/addrbook/jmes/addrbook.json -O ~/.jmes/config/addrbook.json
```

Continue to the [Sync](sync.mdx) page to find out more about syncing your node.
