# 1 Introduction

JMES is an open-source Application-Specific Cryptocurrency created to power JMES World, a decentralized community for art, with the goal of becoming the world's largest decentralized art ecosystem.

Based on the Cosmos SDK and connected to Cosmos Hub (IBC), a validator-based blockchain secured using Tendermint consensus provides the native JMES token (symbol: JMES) for use as a currency for art.

JMES functions as a global decentralized brand, through the implementation of a decentralized core team offering solutions to the network for the overall management and funding of the contributors developing and working on the project.

A business layer enables anyone to kickstart new ideas to grow JMES using funding from the blockchain, as well as the option to act in an Official capacity, by creating sub-DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) within the Governance and funding system.

The design of JMES is to deliver an economic solution to the problem of centralization in the art industry, in the form of a fully incentivized ecosystem where art consumers and producers can form a circular economy and use JMES to secure ownership, incentives and rights to all the Artworks produced both physical and digital.

This is needed to enable JMES to scale as a decentralized global application using free-market principles to explore and deliver the right incentive and business models to grow its userbase.

JMES has a max supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens and 6 decimal units called Nils, a blocktime of around 5 seconds, an initial block reward of 20 JMES, and a reduction schedule of 12.62079466% every 12 months.

The JMES blockchain is governed by a set of System Smart Contracts detailed below.

# 2 Consensus Layer

The Consensus Layer is the base layer of the platform consisting of a native JMES cryptocurrency implemented as a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain secured by an incentivized peer-to-peer (P2P) Validator network employing the Tendermint consensus algorithm.

## 2.1 Validators

To ensure fairness and security of the JMES protocol it's implemented using a PoS consensus algorithm which determines the weight of validators in the P2P network by the amount of staked JMES used as collateral.

To be a validator candidate, the operator needs to broadcast a specific create\_validator message to the network. The selection of the active validators is then made based on the weight of their stake. The active validator set is limited to 100 validators at the protocol level, and chosen by the largest amount of stake (including delegated stake). Losing staked coins and falling out of the top 100 rank or being disconnected from the network sets the validator to inactive causing it to lose its spot in the active set, no longer participating in consensus or earning rewards.

The selected validator of the active validator set will produce the next block in the blockchain and earn 50% of the block reward, with the other 50% being sent directly to the wallets of the DAOs with winning proposals in the system, any unused allocation isn't created.

Note that in terms of distribution, at no time are newly created coins held in custody either by an individual wallet or a smart contract. Rather, newly created coins are always distributed directly to the recipient, e.g. validators, delegators or DAOs.

## 2.2 Delegation

Any holder of JMES can delegate their JMES to a running validator, by bonding an amount of JMES in their own wallet. The block reward is split proportionally across all delegators, with the coins created whenever those delegators redeem them individually.

For the cost of running the validator, the validator operator can define a commission rate that would be charged to delegators, which will become active after the first 28 day initial distribution period (see below).

A validator can also self-delegate.

## 2.3 Tokenomics

JMES has a max supply of 1,000,000,000 coins, each divisible into 6 decimal units (known individually as Nils). Average blocktime is 5 seconds and the initial block reward is 18 JMES, with a reduction schedule of 12.62079466% every 12 months.

A total premint of 100,000,000 JMES, or 10% of maximum supply, is issued as block reward in four transactions to four premint addresses in the genesis block. However, these premint coins are locked against spending and voting in the protocol initially, then unlocked with each consecutive block by an amount in proportion to the intended total premint % of max supply, i.e. 10%. For example, with the initial block reward of 18 JMES per block before the first block reward reduction period, 2 of the JMES locked in the premint wallets are also unlocked per block, in proportion to the wallets share of the total premint, meaning the effective total addition to circulating supply was 20 JMES in that block. After the first reduction, when block reward is reduced to 15.7283 JMES per block, the total unlocked premint reduces to 1.7476 JMES per block for that period, and so forth.

The unlocked coins can be spent and voted with, but are still locked against staking, to avoid a situation where the 10% is exceeded by the premine holders, which would break the intention of the premine agreements. This approach combined means that the maximum percent of circulating supply that is issued to preminters does not exceed the intended 10% allocation.

## 2.4 Initial Distribution Period

The Initial distribution of JMES is achieved with a fair launch where anyone can setup a validator to compete to mine JMES.

The code for JMES is fully open-source under MIT/Apache2 license and will be published on Github ready for anyone to compile and instantiate the first validator that will then mine the first block and effectively launch the JMES Network.

At launch, because JMES isn't available to stake into new validators, an Initial Distribution Period of 483 840 blocks (~28 days) is implemented from genesis where no stake is required to enter the active validator set, although validators in the set are sorted based on the weight of validator stakes. If validators drop out of the set during the initial distribution period, i.e. the number of active validators drops below 100, additional existing validators not in the set are selected at random to join the set. This means that mining JMES in the initial distribution period is given to the first 100 validators to join, or consequently validators waiting to join after that time once space becomes available, i.e. distribution is on a first-come-first-serve basis. After the initial distribution period ends, a stake is required to join the set, meaning if the number of validators in the set drops below the 100 limit, validators outside of the set without a stake won't be allowed into the set.

Validator's commission will only activate at the end of this 483,840 blocks period (resulting in a 0% effective commission rate for the first 28 days).

As a Cosmos compatible blockchain, JMES can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies using existing Cosmos compatible Dexes (decentralized exchanges). The initial JMES source code developers will not provide any direct exchange services. 3rd party exchange services exist that can be integrated into the client wallet if the DAO decides to pursue this option after launch.

During this initial distribution period of 483 840 blocks, the 50% DAO rewards portion of block rewards (5,259,600 JMES) aren't sent to DAOs, as DAOs can only be created when that period ends. Instead, these coins are allocated to Validators, meaning that validators earn 100% of the block rewards during this period, from the genesis block until block 483,841.

Note that there is no facility at the base layer to engage in any kind of brokerage between JMES tokens and other assets.

# 3 Business Layer

The Business Layer is a novel way to bridge real-world entities to the Consensus Layer through incentivized decentralization.

Comprising a collective of DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) created and governed by the community, it represents and funds tangible businesses and organizations via the blockchain, with DAOs able to effectively "mine" up to 50% of block rewards.

DAOs convert that funding into user growth and increased economic activity in JMES, measured by the community via the Governance System, by delivering value-adding services as dictated by community needs, spanning use-cases from tokenizing real-world assets, on-boarding and incentivizing artists, managing physical spaces and hosting events, to developing core software and strategically overseeing the JMES brand.

DAOs stimulate user growth and economic activity in JMES by providing valuable services as per community needs, including tokenization of real-world assets, artist management, event hosting, software development, and strategic brand management. The Governance System monitors this progress.

The Business Layer is implemented as a suite of System Smart Contracts. These smart contracts are integrated into the Consensus Layer, enabling its core Identity, DAO, and Governance services.

## 3.1 Identities

Identities are the core construct in the Business Layer representing users who will engage with the system as individuals or as a group (as members of a DAO), implemented via a System Contract called the Identity Service within the Business Layer.

The Identity Service provides the ability to register validated, human-readable names for User Identities and Dao Identities. Both Identity types share the same namespace to protect impersonation attacks.

Identities can be resolved via bi-directional lookup: A wallet address can be resolved into a name and a name can be resolved into a wallet address. It also allows you to retrieve a paginated list of all existing daos.

### 3.1.1 User Identities

To make it easier for people to interact socially in JMES and prevent spoofing, users can create their own User Identities, essentially user profiles, enabling anyone to sign up with a unique username on the blockchain, that includes an optional non-unique full name, and in future an extensible HD pub key for transaction purposes can be added.

### 3.1.2 DAO Identities

DAO Identities are special Identities that any User Identity can create, the instances of which we refer to as DAOs in JMES, that represent real-world businesses and organizations that are funded from the blockchain via the Governance System.

A name for the DAO must be provided on creation that is unique across the shared DAO Identity and User Identity namespace, to make it easier to identify and find them in the network, and prevent spoofing via a duplicate DAO name.

### 3.2.3 Official Features

Official Features are special features available within the Business Layer that can be awarded to any DAO that requests them via a Governance Proposal that is passed by voting bJMES holders.

Generally, Official Features provide the framework for producers and consumers of art to interact and exchange value and intellectual property in ways that satisfy the compliance, quality and standards that the community deems necessary to officially represent the JMES brand.

Specifically, Official Features assign permissions for DAOs that obtain them to call specific System Smart Contracts that perform the actions the feature enables, which will often be to mint certain non-fungible token representing assets that are officially sanctioned by the Governance System, which represents the JMES community as a whole.

It's possible to verify assets produced by DAOs with Official Features by proving the origination from the DAO who minted them, and that they had the Official Feature in question permissioned via the relevant Governance Proposal at the time.

Initially, the only Official Feature is for the DAO to act as an Art Dealer, giving them permission to mint Official Artwork NFTs.

Each DAO can be awarded with multiple Official Features at any time, so that DAOs themselves are not considered Official as a whole, only in the use of specific features that they take. Unless the feature in question is the Official Status feature, which provides a generic Official status without any protocol-level features.

Note that Core DAOs are always considered to have Official status in the system, meaning all their actions are Official, as described below.

### 3.2.4 Core DAOs

The protocol allows for 3 DAOs to be elected into Core Slots via a Governance Proposal, providing them with Official Status and enabling them to work together to provide Core functions for the JMES ecosystem, but at the same time be removable or replaceable at all times.

Known collectively as the Core DAOs, the DAOs occupying the Core Slots form essentially a decentralized version of the Core Team found in other cryptocurrencies.

The three Core Slot positions available in the protocol are named to represent the functions the DAOs that occupy the slots will perform:

1. Brand, Marketing & Communications

2. Community Engagement

3. Engineering

## 3.3 Governance System

Governance in JMES is the process whereby DAOs request Funding from the blockchain and Official Features from the Business Layer via Governance Proposals they create, and are voted on by bJMES holders within a recurring 4-week Governance Cycle, that tallies the votes and either passes or fails the Governance Proposals in question.

### 3.3.1 Governance Proposals

Any DAO can create a Governance Proposal by burning an amount of 10 JMES to send the proposal to the Governance System Contract (GSC).

There are five types of Governance Proposal that any DAO can create:

#### 3.3.1.1 Text Proposal

A Text Proposal is the most basic type of Governance Proposal, consisting of a Title and a Description, and an optional attachment of a Funding Request.

Without a Funding Request, Text Proposals enable DAOs to take a survey in the network on a topic that may relate to the DAO or anything outside the DAO.

With a Funding Request attached, the Text Proposal can be used as the basic element to funding DAOs from the blockchain. An example could be the commissioning of an art piece.

#### 3.3.1.2 Request Feature Proposal

A Request Feature Proposal allows a DAO to request permission to use an Official Feature from the set of available Official Features within the System Smart Contracts maintained on the Business Layer by the currently elected Engineering Core DAO.

This type of proposal also requires the DAO who creates it to attach a Funding Request, with the period of the funding used to revoke the permission to use the feature when the funding period expires, if the proposal passes. Note that the funding amount can still be specified as zero, but the period must be specified.

#### 2.3.1.3 Core Slot Proposal

A Core Slot Proposal is a Governance Proposal that enables any DAO to request to occupy a Core Slot, enabling it to perform functions as part of the decentralized Core Team.

Each DAO can request to be assigned to occupy one of the Core Slots via a Core Slot proposal, but each DAO can only be in one of the Core Slots at any given time.

If a Core Slot is taken, a new DAO being approved into a Core Slot via the Governance system will automatically replace the current DAO in that slot.

If two or more DAOs apply for the same Core Slot in the same voting period, the one with the highest net YES vote count wins.

After voting on Core Slots has finished, the winning DAOhas to formally accept its appointment during the acceptance period after the voting has ended by sending the appropriate message to the Governance System Contract.

A Funding Request must be attached to each Core Slot Proposal, so that the period can be used to revoke the Core Slot on expiry. However, the amount in the Funding Request may be specified as zero.

 A Core DAO can be verified as occupying a Core Slot if if they have a passed and non-expired Core Slot proposal existing, with no subsequent Core Slot proposals by another DAO for the same Core Slot was passed, and no subsequent Revoke Core Slot Proposal for the DAO's Core Slot that passed.

#### 3.3.1.4 Improvement Proposal

Improvement proposals implement code migration changes to the System Smart Contracts and can be raised by any DAO in the network.

If the proposal is passed, the code upgrade will automatically be performed upon conclusion of the proposal. If they are not approved, the code update will not be executed.

#### 3.3.1.5 Revoke Core Slot Proposal

A Revoke Core Slot proposal can also remove any DAO that's occupying a Core Slot, which if passes, leaves the Slot empty.

Note that a Core DAO proposal can effectively enact a revocation of another DAO's occupation of a specific Core Slot. For the current Core DAO to not be replaced, it needs to submit a competing proposal and pass with a higher net YES vote than the new DAO applying for the slot.

### 3.3.2 Funding Requests

DAOs may include a Funding Request as an attachment to any Governance Proposal type, except a Revoke Core-Slot Proposal. This requests permission to issue new coins to themselves within their own wallet, from within the 50% of total block rewards available across all winning DAO proposals, if the Governance Proposal passes.

The request for funding must include an amount of JMES and a number of months over which the JMES will be paid, which is converted to number of blocks by the GSC, using the average block time of 5 seconds and the assumption of 2,629,746 seconds in a month.

For example, a DAO wants to be able to allocate themselves 1,000 new JMES tokens between blocks 300 and 800 out of the total DAO block reward budget.

This means that if passed, the funding component of the proposal enables the DAO Identity to create the requested allocation of new JMES in their own wallet via the Distribution System Contract (DSC) at any block height between the block start and end, and they will be able to create those coins at the moment the proportional amount has matured, and at 800 they have created 100% of the amount requested.

The maximum funding that each DAO can request in a cycle is 25% of the total DAO budget.

Note that the % of the total budget for Core DAOs is capped at 40% of the total DAO budget (so 25% of total block rewards). This means that if the combined ask (amount requested in proposals) of the Core DAOs exceeds the [50%] cap on the total DAO budget, the Core DAO proposals with the lowest votes that exceed that amount won't be funded.

### 3.3.3 Governance Cycle

The Governance Cycle is the recurring period of DAOs raising Governance Proposals followed by JMES holders voting on those proposals. It is split into two weeks of raising Governance Proposals, followed by two weeks of voting on those proposals, at which point votes are tallied and the cycle loops. This means that a minimum of 8 days is required to create a proposal and have it voted in.

The Governance Cycle starts at the genesis block so that new proposals can be raised in the first two weeks after the blockchain is launched and voting in weeks three and four, meaning that the first DAO proposals will be tallied 4 weeks after the genesis block. The cycle continues from that point.

Note that the Governance Cycle periods are calculated based on time, with 60,6864 seconds in a week, every other calculation uses block height.

### 3.3.4 Voting

Any JMES holder is eligible to vote on any Governance Proposal if they have the minimum stake of 1,000 JMES.

Voting requires the JMES to be bonded for a validator in the user's own wallet, meaning those JMES are marked with a special status as unspendable and only usable for the purpose of tallying them for voting and derivation of staking rewards from the validator they're bonded to.

Bonded coins remain in the owner's wallet at all times and are never transmitted or under the control of another wallet.

Unbonding JMES has a delay of 21 days during which time they can't be used for voting or earning staking rewards, however, bonding is instant, and instantly gives voting rights.

### 3.3.5 Tallying

Votes on Governance Proposals are tallied at the end of the voting cycle and a determination is made on which proposals pass or fail via the protocol as follows:

Governance Proposals pass when the net total of YES votes is equal to or greater than 10% of total possible votes at the end of the voting period. This means that after NO votes are subtracted from YES votes, the number of YES votes remaining must be equal to or greater than 10% of all bonded JMES at the time the vote is tallied.

For Governance Proposals that pass with non-zero Funding Requests, on each block during the funding period of the request, the decision to allow funding is calculated by ordering all Governance Proposals with Funding Requests eligible at the time of the current block in order of YES minus NO votes. This means that the more popular Governance Proposals get priority within the available block rewards allocated to the DAO budget, and once the first eligible proposal's entitlement would exceed that request, it and any less popular proposals following it are not paid.

In the case of multiple Core Slot Proposals competing for the same Core Slot are made within a cycle, the Core Slot Proposal with the highest net YES votes passes. If there isn't a single highest net YES vote then none of the competing Core Slot Proposals passes within that cycle.
