# JMES Incubator

<Admonition type="info" icon="ℹ️">

Welcome to the JMES Incubator!

Please signup to Incubator using our [Trello Board](http://jmes.cloud) and read the [Rules](./incubator-whitepaper) in our Whitepaper.

You can also track all Incubator transactions via our [Open-source Accounting](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FbiDxVXXL6LK4XvbJa0gsNom_jqYxd7VJnG49dqGtpY/edit?usp=sharing)

[JMES Incubator](https://incubator.jmes.cloud/) is a Decentralized Autonomous Organisation (DAO) that uses a micro-incentive bounty system to fund development of JMES projects by external subject experts.

Incubator is open sourced and governed by this set of [rules](https://github.com/jmesworld/incubator/blob/main/rules.md) defined and tracked on the JMES Github.

After the JMES Blockchain mainnet launch, Incubator will apply to become a blockchain funded DAO comprising of the following three tier user structure:

- Directors - a third tier of users incentivized to manage the ways of working, Road Map, accept / activate projects, hold and move JMES coins, and post proposals to the network for funding.
- Admins - a second tier of users incentivized to manage Projects by earning a commission on completed Tasks.
- Contributors - subject matter experts who contribute towards Projects by completing tasks and claiming rewards.

Incubator uses the [Trello management tool](https://trello.com/b/oJCXdSrM/jmes-incubator) to track JMES Projects against corresponding Project cards called Bounties.


Bounties are fulfilled by subject experts tasked with specifying, designing, building and quality assuring project components.

Directors create Bounties, specify high level project requirements, delivery dates and list stakeholders before passing to Admins to run all aspects of the project.

Directors transfer JMES coins to Contributors for tasks completed and to Admins incentivized with a percentage of the tasks approved on the projects they run.


Admins create tasks, define task deliverables, deadlines and incentives to be claimed and paid.

Admins find contributors for tasks or accept applicants for open tasks.

Once tasks are complete and claimed by the contributor, Admins review the output or assign a QA task to an independent contributor for a formal review.

Once confirmed as meeting the deliverable, the task is approved by the Admin and this [Payment Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FbiDxVXXL6LK4XvbJa0gsNom_jqYxd7VJnG49dqGtpY/edit?usp=sharing) updated with details of the Task, Incentive, Contributor and an address for the reward to be sent.

### Projects

Since inception in August 22, Incubator produced the following meta (internal to Incubator) milestones:

- [Rules](https://github.com/jmesworld/incubator/blob/main/rules.md) definition - the terms between JMES Incubator and Treasury that bind Incubator to how funding will be used.

- [Infrastructure](https://trello.com/b/oJCXdSrM/jmes-incubator) design and setup - a Trello Project Management system using custom JMES project covers that give an original JMES art centric polished look and feel and allow open sourced and fully transparent projects to be run.

- [Concept](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bja1xZdyePHanLOhhcfIZVrSrcyLiByfcyo3QpxK2Gg/edit?usp=sharing), [Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1miuDy03Fdem_8_OiYCFv73yw9c1lbI0cIJDywVO_kEY/edit?usp=sharing), [QA Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Nski9W1TcWIgPfwLwDCQwbbO2PNGeX7XdfU8Sft0WY/edit?usp=sharing) template creation - custom JMES branded fully functional templates used by Contributors in the completion of tasks against JMES projects.

- [Payment process](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FbiDxVXXL6LK4XvbJa0gsNom_jqYxd7VJnG49dqGtpY/edit?usp=sharing) definition - a transparent payment system allowing all handling and allocation of Incubator funds to be publicly verified in real-time via the JMES Blockchain.

The following JMES Projects have been funded by JMES Incubator in 2022:

- [App - Smart Contract Integration](https://trello.com/c/5aOrVEL8) - integration of JMES smart contracts into the JMES Art App allowing full integration to the JMES blockchain.

- [Proposals / voting webpage](https://trello.com/c/o1UhzTDC) - allowing users to request profile features to become Artists; Curators; Clubs; Dealer, to create DAO's, proposals for funding and to vote.

- [Documentation website](https://trello.com/c/ig9qtTwZ) - a website to store developer tools, guides and any documentation required by developers working on the JMES blockchain.

- [App - Core Development](https://trello.com/c/jIIW0lJr) - Version 1 of the JMES App with full working wallet allowing users to create an identity and to store, send & receive JMES coins.

- [App - Core Development](https://trello.com/c/jIIW0lJr) - Version 2 of the JMES Art App allowing Users, Artists and Curators to buy and sell Art; sign up for JMES events, and enjoy many more features.
- On successful application as a blockchain funded DAO, Incubator will look to scale by adding further Directors, Admins and Contributors that support the development of future JMES Projects and DAO's.
